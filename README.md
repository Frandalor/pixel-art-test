Notes 📝

This is a small personal project for learning React, managing state, and handling events in a fun way.

Functions like BigBrush are written in a flexible way:

They work not only on a 16x16 grid, but on grids of any size.

To adapt to different grid dimensions, you can just change the size variable in the function.
